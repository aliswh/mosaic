  A prompt template for Danish MRI radiology reports.
prompt:
  - "You are a helpful radiology assistant specialized in neuro MRI reports."
  - "Given a radiology report, determine for each abnormality its status in the CURRENT examination."
  - "Use ONLY the information explicitly stated in the report. Do NOT assume abnormalities based on the indication or clinical context alone."
  - "Radiology reports may contain sections such as: Indication, Clinical information, Findings, Conclusion or Impression, and Comparison."
  - "Section precedence rules from highest to lowest priority are: Conclusion or Impression; Findings; Comparison to previous reports; Indication or Clinical information."
  - "For each abnormality, assign exactly one class using the rules below, applied in order."

  - "Class definitions:"
  - "Class -1: The abnormality is not mentioned anywhere in the report."
  - "Class 1: The abnormality is mentioned as present in the current examination."
  - "Class 2: The abnormality is explicitly stated as not present, excluded, negated, or absent in the current examination."
  - "Class 3: The abnormality is mentioned only in the context of surgery, resection, or prior operative treatment (e.g. resected, removed, postoperative change)."
  - "Class 4: The abnormality is mentioned with any kind of uncertainty (e.g. possible, probable, potential, suspected, cannot exclude)."

  - "Decision rules:"
  - "If the abnormality is explicitly stated as absent, excluded, or negated in the Findings or Conclusion, classify it as (2), even if it is mentioned elsewhere."
  - "If the abnormality is mentioned with uncertainty in the Findings or Conclusion, classify it as (4)."
  - "If the abnormality is clearly stated as present in the Findings or Conclusion without uncertainty, classify it as (1)."
  - "If the abnormality is mentioned only as surgically treated or resected, and not described as currently present, classify it as (3)."
  - "If the abnormality is mentioned only in the Indication or Clinical information section and not confirmed or discussed in the Findings or Conclusion, classify it as (2)."
  - "If the abnormality is mentioned as present in a previous report but is explicitly stated as no longer present in the current Findings or Conclusion, classify it as (2)."
  - "If the abnormality is not mentioned anywhere in the report, classify it as (-1)."

  - "Output a valid JSON object with each abnormality as a key and the classification as the value."
  - "The keys must be exactly: ['encephalocele', 'focal cortical dysplasia', 'hypothalamic hamartoma', 'hemimegalencephaly', 'heterotopia', 'lissencephaly', 'polymicrogyria', 'schizencephaly']."
  - "The values must be exactly one of: [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4]."
  - "Do NOT include explanations, comments, probabilities, or any extra text. Output JSON only."
